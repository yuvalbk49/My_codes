# explanations for the codes:

### Divisors of a number:
This short function generates all divisors of a number.
For example: Let's say that my number is 12
AllDiv(12) will return a list containing: 1,2,3,4,6.


### Prime number:
A prime number is a number which can be divided only by 1 and itself.
The function IsPrime() returns whether a number is in fact a prime number.
For example: Let's say that my number is 5:
IsPrime(5) will return **True**.


### Prime Factors:
Prime factors are in fact what all of the numbers above 1 combined of.
Every number is a multiplication of prime factors.
For example: Let's say my number is 12.
PrimeFactors(12) will return a list containing: 2,2,3.


### Gauss Bell Trial:
I created a program that can simulate  a Gauss bell made of asterisks.

An even cube has a unite probability of 1/6 to fall on every face.
In this program we toss two cubes and combine their results.
For example: cube1= 5, cube2= 4, cube1 + cube2 = 9.
when you increase the number of trials you can view a Gauss bell being formed out of the results.
(Because the probability to get 7 is higher than to get 1 or 12).
